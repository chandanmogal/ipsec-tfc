A rather heavily improvised collection of benchmarking scripts.
====================================================================

Since the TFC module has a lot of inter-dependent options and
settings must be consistent on multiple hosts, this was used to
assure consistent and sychronous benchmarking.

Basically, the testbed consists of 2 gateways tfc1/tfc2, two
hosts cli1/cli2, and a man-in-the-middle "mitm" which monitors
the IPsec traffic:

             cli1 - tfc1 = mitm = tfc2 - cli2

The code repository is copied to all hosts. Then once client uses
ssh to automatically configure the hosts, and run and store the
appropriate benchmarks/measurements.  Note that the scripts use
the IPsec setup scripts in ../config/*

config.sh - configure the host names and script components

all-clean.sh
	Clean the TFC config on all hosts

all-sync.sh
	Synchronize clock on all hosts (NTP)

test-plain.sh <raw|esp|tfc>

	Perform raw rate/throughput benchmark using no IPsec, ESP
	tunnel, or ESP tunnel with TFC header but no
  normalization/obfuscation. To determine testbed performance
	and soundness of ESP/TFC operation/overhead.

test-tfc.sh <mode>

	Test certain preconfigured TFC enforcement modes to determine how the
  enforcement affects rate/throughput.

test-mgr.sh <leech|web|webamp>

	Test automated TFC management using throughput benchmark (leech) or using
  randomized web traffic with tsung. The TFC management algorithms must be
  adjusted and synchronized out of band, see ../tfc-mgr/
