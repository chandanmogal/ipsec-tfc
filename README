== Overview ==

This is an implementation for Traffic Flow Confidentiality in Linux IPsec.

TFC is implemented an IPsec protocol, like AH and ESP. It is thus applied to
the network packets by the core IPsec engine("XFRM") and configured by setting
appropriate SAs and SPs, typically as boundles(eg ESP-protected TFC).

The project we leverage appeared to focus transport mode with lots of ESP-layers
for onion-routing. By contrast, we only need VPN: ESP+TFC in tunnel mode.

Core implementation includes the following components:

- iproute-xyz-tfc  - patched `ip` to add IPsec SPs and SAs with TFC
- linux-x.y.z-tfc  - linux kernel with XFRM patched for TFC-support


== Usage ==

You can build a testbed with static keys as shown below. Dynamic negotiation of
IPsec SAs by IKE is untested but the ipsec-tools patch by the original TFC
authors was reported to work.

To setup a IPsec tunnel with ESP and TFC protection:

1. Compile and install the patched kernel.

2. Make sure you get basic IPsec working without TFC. Setup networking etc.
   You can use the ip commands in code/config/tfc*-setkey.sh as templates.

4. Using the patched 'ip' tool, configure an IPsec boundle with TFC inside ESP
   in tunnel mode. Other configurations are not tested but AH and transport mode
   might work.

5. Configure the corresponding IPsec SAs for ESP and TFC using the patched 'ip'.

6. Adjust the runtime TFC parameters in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tfc/<destIP>:<SPI>/
   to your needs, eg to set constant IPD of 50ms and 800kb packet size use:
   echo 50 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tfc/10-0-1-1:23/pkt_delay_avg
   echo 800 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tfc/10-0-1-1:23/pkt_len_avg


For example configurations see the two script tfc1-setkey.sh, tfc2-setkey.sh in
/code/config/.  The scripts are intended to setup two IPsec-gateways(tfc1,tfc2)
connected via 10.0.0.0/24.  Each gateway has a LAN attached, subnet
192.168.{1,2}.0/24.  Traffic between the LANs is protected with tunnel mode
IPsec, ESP and TFC. TFC is configured on both gateways according to tfc-sa.conf.

Updates and fixes in this repo are by Steffen Schulz, Ruhr-University Bochum.

We leverage the TFC project by the Network Group of the Tor Vergata University,
Italy. The original TFC project repo is very big and outdated and many features
are only partially implemented or not at all. However, they have a plugin for
wireshark and some other stuff for working with rerouting in mix networks.
