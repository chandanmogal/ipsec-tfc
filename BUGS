- How to make the timing most accurate?
  - System load results in missing timeouts, so MITM can measure higher
    timing variance if the gateway is busy. This effect should be minimized.
  - Use hrtimers to measure and compensate local inaccuracies?

- Evaluate if KILL_FROM_TAIL or RED queue policy have any advantages

- remove SPI from TFC
  - otherwise TFC receiver is stateless, does not need x->tfc_params
  - no need to transmit SPI in TFC hdr, but XFRM needs it :-/
  - only needed for inbound CC mitigation, to coordinate inbound IPD enforcement

- implement pkt_rate_variance, eg using iproute/netem approach

- unable to unload module after first traffic (GC is not called for the first
  inbound SA but only after re-init?! sysctl breaks on kmod reload)

- can we do multiplexing without blocking the queue? Does it matter?

- When switching pkt_size, the dummy queue should be flushed

- reduce memory copying/moving/reallocation

- transport mode is untested

- assure that dummies are always indistinguishable
